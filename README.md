# C3X 2018 Ticketing System

## Introduction

This repository serves a main purpose of being a ticketing system. Every ticket will be a new issue, which will have an ID that's easy to track. One project will be created for each team, and each ticket will be put into the project of the team that's responsible for the ticket, and will be assigned to one or more specific person to handle.

## Try It Out

Send me your email, and I'll add you to `https://github.com/K4YT3X/testing-ticketing-system` as a collaborator so you can practice creating and handling tickets. You can make any changes in the repository above.

## Ticket Flow Standard

To make the ticketing system more organized, this standard for handling tickets is recommended to be followed.

1. Always put labels on the ticket.
1. Always put the ticket into a project, it won't be automated otherwise, and will make the system unorganized.
1. Do not move tickets across columns unless needed. Doing so will result in the ticket getting overflowed with action history.
1. More to be added.

## Creating a Ticket

1. Goto "Issues" tab in the repository.
1. Click on "New issue" button to create new ticket.
1. Fill in a descriptive title, and put a detailed description in the comment section.
1. Before submitting the ticket, assign the ticket to the person that is going to handle it, put appropriate labels on the ticket and place the ticket in the corresponding project on the right side of the "New issue" page.
1. Then click "Submit new issue" to create ticket.

## Examples

### Creating a Ticket

When creating a new ticket, notice the column on the right. Assign the issue to assignees, make labels and add it into a project. In our case, Disaster Recovery.

### Viewing the Ticket

The projects for all teams are automated. When you add an issue to a project, it gets added to "To do" automatically. Vice versa, when you close the issue, it gets moved automatically to "Done". You can also overwrite this automation and drag it into any column you want.

To view the ticket content, just click on the blue title of the issue.

### Progress tracking

When the ticket is in "To do", the project page looks like this.

Now we drag the project into the "In progress" column.

You will notice that the color of the entire progress bar has changed to purple, indicating that all projects are in progress.

If a ticket is closed, it will be marked as "Done" automatically. It will show up on the progress bar as green.
